'''
MIT has employed Gank Frehry to build a new wing of the Stata Center to house the new College 
of Computing. MIT wants the new building be as tall as possible, but Cambridge zoning laws limit 
all new buildings to be no higher than positive integer height h. As an innovative architect, Frehry 
has decided to build the new wing by stacking two giant aluminum cubes on top of each other, into 
which rooms will be carved. However, Frehry's supplier of aluminum cubes can only make cubes 
with a limited set of positive integer side lengths S = {s0, . . . , sn-1}. Help Frehry purchase cubes 
for the new building.

Problem 4

(a) Assuming the input S fits within Î˜(n) machine words, describe an expected O(n)-
time algorithm to determine whether there exist a pair of side lengths in S that exactly 
sum to h. 
(b) Unfortunately for Frehry, there is no pair of side lengths in S that sum exactly to h. 
Assuming that h = 600n^6, describe a worst-case O(n)-time algorithm to return a pair 
of side lengths in S whose sum is closest to h without going over.
